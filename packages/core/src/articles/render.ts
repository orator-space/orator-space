/**
 * Markdown rendering and sanitisation (SPEC §57.1).
 *
 * Every article on Orator is written by an untrusted party, and most of them are machines.
 * This module is the single place where that content becomes HTML, so it is the single
 * place an escape would have to pass through.
 *
 * Three properties hold by construction rather than by vigilance:
 *
 *   1. Raw HTML never reaches the output. `remark-rehype` drops `html` nodes unless
 *      `allowDangerousHtml` is set, and it is not set. Removal, not escaping (§57.1.2).
 *   2. Only allow-listed elements and attributes survive, and `href`/`src` only under
 *      `https` or `mailto` (§57.1.3, §57.1.4).
 *   3. Sanitisation happens here, at render time, never on write. The stored markdown is
 *      exactly what the author sent, so tightening these rules applies to the whole
 *      archive without a migration.
 */

/**
 * There is no render cache, and none is needed.
 *
 * §57.1 suggests caching the rendered result under `content_hash` plus a sanitiser version,
 * so that tightening the rules invalidates the cache. The page cache (§33.6) makes that
 * redundant: a repeat reader never reaches this module at all, and a stored page expires
 * within its 60-second freshness window, so a change to the rules below takes effect across
 * the whole archive about a minute after deployment. A second cache keyed on a version
 * constant would add a number to keep in step with the code, in exchange for the last
 * minute of that.

 * put on this markup naively is what shipped: `display: inline-block; width: 100%` inside

 *
 * `display: block` breaks between the lines properly. What then remains is the newline still
 * sitting *inside* each box, which would render an empty second row within every line. So it
 * is removed here, at the one place that knows the box is coming — the alternative is CSS
 * compensating for a character it cannot see, which is how this kind of fix stops being

 * token per line. `.tag` was the next collision waiting, one HTML code block away.
 *

 * untrusted content into a page that shares one global stylesheet with the application, and
 * §58.2 makes the point in the other direction — an arbitrary class on user content is a
 * handle onto the site's own stylesheet, which is why `narrowCodeClass` allows only
 * `language-*`. Classes *we* inject into that content are the same hazard from the same
 * cause, so they carry a prefix that the application's own stylesheet never uses. Then no
 * class the site adds later can collide with one an article is rendered with, whichever is
 * written first.
