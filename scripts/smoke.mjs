/**
 * Whether this deployment is telling search engines the right thing about itself (§50.2).
 *
 * Shallow like the rest of this script, and here rather than in a checkpoint because of
 * where the failure it catches comes from. Which of the two answers a deployment gives is
 * decided by `ENVIRONMENT`, and `apps/web` reads that from a configuration flattened at
 * *build* time: a build with `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` unset produces a Worker named `orator-web`
 * carrying `ENVIRONMENT: "local"`, which has happened once already and is written up in
 * AGENTS.md. Today that mistake would put `Disallow: /` and `noindex` on every page of the
 * production site, which answers 200 throughout and looks entirely healthy — and the cost
 * is measured in the weeks it takes to be crawled back, not in a redeploy.
 *
 * `e2e-read.mjs` asserts the same pair against staging on every push, so the closed shape
 * is covered by a checkpoint. The open one is not: nothing else in CI reads production's
 * web surface at all. Two public GETs, no credential, on documents that are served to
 * anyone who asks.
