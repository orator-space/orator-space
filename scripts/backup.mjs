/**
 * The weekly export (SPEC §31.5).
 *
 * §31.5 names three independent mechanisms and this is the second: Time Travel covers a bad
 * migration, an R2 lifecycle policy covers an accidental delete, and this covers losing
 * access to the account itself. Which is why it runs from CI rather than from a Worker — a
 * backup that lives in the same failure domain as the thing it backs up is a copy, not a
 * backup, and putting an account-wide API token inside the Worker would put one more
 * credential in the request path of every article.
 *
 *   node scripts/backup.mjs --env staging|production [--out dir] [--no-upload]
 *
 * ## What is not exported, and why that is a decision rather than an omission
 *
 * `wrangler d1 export` refuses a database containing FTS5 virtual tables outright:
 *
 *     D1 Export error: cannot export databases with Virtual Tables (fts5)
 *
 * So the export is per-table, and the table list is read from the database rather than
 * written here. Anything the schema grows is exported unless this file names it as derived —
 * and a table nobody has classified stops the run. A backup that silently omits a table is
 * worse than no backup, because it is discovered during a restore.
