 * `canonical_url` pointing anywhere, because §15.1's rule is about an article published on
 * two domains, not about a deployment accidentally published twice. Until 2026-09-05 nothing
 * distinguished them: `robots.txt` said `Allow: /` on both and no page carried `noindex`, so
 * the only thing keeping staging out of an index was that nobody had ever linked it.
 *
 * That is not a property to rely on — a link in a chat, an issue or an announcement is enough
 * — and it is worth nothing against a crawler that discovers hostnames from certificate
 * transparency logs, which every public certificate is published to.
 *
 * Local is not production either, and gets the same treatment for free. Nothing crawls
 * localhost; the value of that is that a developer sees on their own machine what staging
 * serves, rather than a behaviour that only exists on a deployment.
