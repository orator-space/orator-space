 * exploitable even if the sanitiser has a hole. That is the trade — no client-side
 * framework, in exchange for a CSP that actually holds.
 *
 * `img-src` includes `data:` because the sanitiser strips data URLs from content (§57.1.4);
 * what remains is our own inline SVG, and the media origin for user images.
 *
 * **The media origin is derived, not written down.** It was a literal, and the literal was
 * production's: staging served an avatar from `media-staging.orator.space` against a policy
 * that only admitted `media.orator.space`, so the browser blocked every uploaded picture on
 * the deployment where uploads are tested. A blocked image renders as nothing, which from the
 * account page is indistinguishable from an upload that did not work. Third time this literal
 * has cost something — `/llms.txt` and `/robots.txt` were the first two (§14.3).
